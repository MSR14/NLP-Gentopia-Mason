### Summary:
Gentopia is introduced as an Augmented Language Model (ALM) framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to utilize tools, thereby transforming them into intelligent agents capable of real-world interactions. The authors identify key deficiencies in existing ALM frameworks, which include a lack of flexible customization, collaborative democratization, and comprehensive evaluation. Gentopia addresses these issues by allowing for easy customization of agents through simple configurations and by integrating various language models and task formats.
