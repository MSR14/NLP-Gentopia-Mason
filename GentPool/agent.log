INFO:root:Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Sales at the Green House**:
   - She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]

2. **Remaining Vacuum Cleaners after Green House**:
   - After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **Sales at the Red House**:
   - She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at red house} = 2
   \]

4. **Remaining Vacuum Cleaners after Red House**:
   - After selling at the red house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

5. **Sales at the Orange House**:
   - She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

6. **Remaining Vacuum Cleaners after Orange House**:
   - The number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   - To simplify this, we can factor out \( \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \):
   \[
   = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   - Thus, the remaining vacuum cleaners can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

7. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We know that after all the sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

8. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   - Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

9. **Conclusion**:
   - Melanie started with \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners.

### Verification:
- **Green House**: Sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) (remaining: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \))
- **Red House**: Sold \( 2 \) (remaining: \( 12 - 2 = 10 \))
- **Orange House**: Sold \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) (remaining: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \))

The calculations confirm that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, verifying that the solution is correct.
